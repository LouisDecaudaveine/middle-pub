# Middle Pub

Do you have a friend that lives across London with plans to meet at the pub. Use this nifty little app to find the pubs between both of you. Currently based on pubs with equivilant transit times. 

Deployed live [here](https://middle-pub.vercel.app/)

New middle metrics coming soon:  **as the crow flies** and **cycling**.
